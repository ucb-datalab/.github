## About the Course

The Astronomy Data Science Lab is a project-based course that provides students with practical experience in astronomical data analysis. The course consists of three data-centric laboratory experiments that draw on tools used by professional astronomers.

### What You'll Learn

Students in this course will:

- **Procure and clean data** from world-class astronomical facilities (Kepler, Gaia, SDSS, Hubble Space Telescope)
- **Assess data quality** and fidelity using statistical methods
- **Build and apply models** to describe astronomical phenomena
- **Analyze data** using advanced techniques (Bayesian inference, machine learning, parallel computing)
- **Develop software** with emphasis on Python programming and reproducible research practices
- **Communicate results** effectively through written reports, presentations, and data visualization

### Topics & Data Sources

The labs explore fundamental questions in astronomy using data from premier observatories:

- **Structure and composition of the Milky Way** using Gaia astrometry
- **Stellar properties and evolution** with Kepler light curves
- **Galaxy formation and evolution** from SDSS and Hubble imaging
- **Variable stars and interstellar dust** characterization

### Course Format

- **4 credits**
- **2 weekly 1.5-hour meetings**
- **3.5 laboratory projects** with checkpoint presentations
- **Heavy emphasis on software development**, statistical analysis, and scientific communication

### Requirements Satisfied

- **Data Science Major**: Satisfies "Computational & Inferential Depth" requirement
- **Astronomy Major**: Satisfies Laboratory requirement
